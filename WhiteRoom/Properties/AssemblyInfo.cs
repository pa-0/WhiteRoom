AutoHotkey-Flavored Semantic Versioning

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.FEATURE.PATCH, increment the:

    MAJOR version when major breaking changes are made,
    MINOR version when minor breaking changes that do not affect a majority of users,
    FEATURE version when backwards-compatible (or breaking in rare cases) new features are added, and
    PATCH version when mere bug fixes are made. A release with a significant number of bug fixes can lead into a 'FEATURE' version bump.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the given format.

Pre-release/stable software version tag format: 0.BUILD[TAG]-PHASE
